Changes Made:
    Re-named html (specifically <div></div>) sections to more syntax appropriate labels to help with specificty to placement on the page.

    Condensed similar CSS elements (specifically .benefit) to reduce redundancy

    Changed the class in the main section to a more specific name and used that to include all elements to reduce redundancy 

    I commented out most things instead of deleting in CSS to keep from having to go back and forth
